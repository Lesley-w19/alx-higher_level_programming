# 0x09-python-everything_is_object

 ##### Both “is” and “==” are used for object comparison in Python. The operator “==” compares values of two objects, while “is” checks if two objects are same (In other words two references to same object).

 ##### Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
 --- Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
 --- A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
 --- Tuples are written with round brackets.

 ##### id(object)
 --- The id() function returns a unique id for the specified object.
 --- All objects in Python has its own unique id.
 --- The id is assigned to the object when it is created.
 --- The id is the object's memory address, and will be different for each time you run the program. (except for some object that has a constant unique id, like integers from -5 to 256)
